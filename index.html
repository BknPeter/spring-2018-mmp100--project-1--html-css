      <p style="border:10px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FFD700; padding: 1em;">The NBA is full of the best basketball players in the world and the one who has been most consitent is LeBron James. He has been the face of the NBA and the best player in the world who came straight from high school! Born in Akron Ohio and drafted #1 overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers LeBron has showed excallance and dominance in basicallly every aspect of the game. He has won 3 championships two with The Miami Heat and one with the Cleveland Cavaliers. At age 33 he still seems to be in his prime and competeing for championships. LeBron helps his community as well, he recently created the <a href="http://lebronjamesfamilyfoundation.org/"style="color: grey"/a>LeBron James Family Foundation</a> which pledged to send 1,100 kids to college all expeses payed, which costed $41 million dollars.</p>

     <p style="border:15px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FFD700; padding: 1em;">What I find interesting of LeBron is the way he's handled himself since he came into the NBA. He came out of high school at 17 and since then he has carried himself with class and professionalism, and sustained greatness for longer then any NBA player before him.</p>
